Converts Synthesia video to MIDI, note sheets PDF and Music XML.  
Works with YouTube video links.  
Should work with any piano roll software, but tested on Synthesia. 


# TODOs

1. Make it work with background images below keys: remove static parts of the frame.
2. Remove irrelevant parts of a video: autodetect intro and outro.
3. Make it work with a lot of sparkles: improve thresholding.
4. Make it work with flashy starts when keys are immediately near the real play line: autodetect actual play line.
