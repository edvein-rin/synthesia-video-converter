Converts Synthesia video to MIDI, note sheets PDF and Music XML.  
Works with YouTube video links.  
Should work with any piano roll software, but tested on Synthesia. 


# TODOs

1. Remove irrelevant parts of a video: autodetect intro and outro.
2. Make it work with flashy starts when keys are immediately near the real play line: autodetect actual play line.
3. Make it work with background images below keys: remove static parts of the frame.
4. Make it work with a lot of sparkles: improve thresholding.
5. Add progress bar.


**Enchantments**

1. Add pausing video during debugging.
2. Add switching between visual modes during debugging (original frame, gray scale, threshold, thick line etc).
